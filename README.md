# PURPOSE

In recent months, as the COVID-19 situation unfolds, we’ve seen a battle of the fittest within our economy; a chance to float or sink. Some businesses thrived, others fell behind, and many had to recede. So what’s the secret? How did the pandemic widen the gap between businesses large and small?
 
The answer is digitalization. Studies reveal that digitally mature companies are 23% more profitable than their less mature peers. And as our world shifts online, that gap will only continue to grow.

Valeo revolutionizes market growth through the quantification of actions we wouldn’t traditionally consider. A simplistic web-tool, we encourage small businesses to build their online presence to expand their market reach and accessibility.

# BUSINESS SUSTAINABILITY 

At Valeo, we strive for growth in all aspects: in our user base, our functionality, and our viability. 

Our simplistic interface, minimal information capture, and versatile data usage allow for businesses of any stage and type to get involved. We ensure that no one is left behind: whether you’re a young entrepreneur creating a start-up, or in an established family business: our design allows any demographic to jump right in, anytime, anywhere.
 
Valeo is built for the users, and our structure reflects exactly that. A light-weight front-end, built with React, paired with authentication and data retrieval through Firebase, ensures speed and security. The chatbot, created with Microsoft Azure and their artificial intelligence technologies, ensure a personalized experience. We’re looking forward to taking things a step forward by integrating auth0 user profiles and hosting on the cloud! 

The best part? Valeo never fades away: as the digital world grows, we only have more advice to give! As AI technologies improve and resources expand, Valeo can only grow. The path forward is endless, and we wish to guide you every step of the way.

## FEATURES

- DATA LOGGER: You can easily log in data points: your net sales, as well as ranking your efforts in these digitalization categories: ecommerce, social media, online ads, and more. Your rankings are visualized, and advice is personally curated based off of your rankings.

- CHATBOT: Valeo, your very own AI advisor, will give you tips and resources based on what you want to find. Our database expands to over 50 resources, with an in-depth analysis of the opportunities and fallbacks of each, guaranteeing you to find the best path for your business.
 
- COVID-19 TRACKER: With the current situation, your performance does not always accurately depict your success. We retrieve real-time COVID information based on your location to give you reminders that small steps backward don't mean you aren’t moving forwards.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack with CRUD, personalized Microsoft Azure chatbot, COVID-19 API, and chartJS

## NEXT STEPS

As this is a demo, we did not get to authenticating users and connecting it to our MongoDB database. However, next steps for Valeo include linking Auth0 with MongoDB and continuing to develop algorithms to personalize the user experience. We aim to host it on the cloud through Microsoft Azure to minimize maintenance so we can maximize time spent on the end user.
